Pyhthon Scripts for Pimoroni Scroll pHat HD

I cannot claim much (if any) credit for the code in this repository... all orignally written by the pimoroni team. My contribution 
was to update the code so it works on the pHat HD.

For this reason I think that life.py and sine.py aren't quite right... so if anyone can see what I have done wrong please do let me
know.
