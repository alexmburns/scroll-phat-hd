Pyhthon Scripts for Pimoroni Scroll pHat HD

bin-clock.py is a binary clock

bmp.py allows you to display a bmp file of your choice onto your Scroll pHAT HD (I have included a couple of .bmp files you can use)

console-type.py allows you to type words into terminal, they will then be displayed on your Scroll pHAT HD

count.py will count down from a given number (see inside file for more details)

countdown.py allows you to set a timer in HH:MM which will display on your Scroll pHAT HD.

game-input.py will ask you 3 questions, remember the answer and then display these answers in the form of a sentence on your Scroll pHAT HD.

ip.py will display your current public IP address.

life.py - I am unsure exactly what this does, it is an adapted script from the non HD library.

sine.py displays a sine wave on your Scroll pHAT HD

txt-to-phat.py prints the contents of test.txt into Scroll pHat HD, remember to change directory to be valid.

Hopefully the others are fairly obvious from the file name... but message me if you are unsure.

life.py and sine.py aren't quite right... so if anyone can see what I have done wrong please do let me
know.
